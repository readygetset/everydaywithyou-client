# EverydayWithYou Client
> This project was conducted as part of the 2023 Korea University College of Informatics Hackathon, "InThon."

## Motivation
In many countries, family is considered the most meaningful aspect of life, while in South Korea, material wealth often ranks first. To emphasize the importance and value of family, we created "Everyday with You."

## Features
This app offers two main features to enhance family connection and understanding:
1. **Question and Answer**: Each user can answer a daily question, and their responses are shared within the family. This allows family members to discover new aspects of each other and deepen their bonds.
2. **Anonymous Letters**: Users can send anonymous letters to their family members, making it easy to share thoughts and feelings in a light-hearted way.
By promoting open communication within a unique family diary format, "Everyday with You" fosters a happier, more vibrant, and healthier family community.
